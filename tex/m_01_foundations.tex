% Evolution is change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations.
% \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution}
% the process by which new species or populations of living things develop from preexisting forms through successive generations
% \url{https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/evolution}
% Evolution is a process of continuous branching and diversification from common trunks. This pattern of irreversible separation gives life's history its basic directionality. —Stephen Jay Gould

Life on Earth has been around for about 3.5 billion years.

Evolution is the continuous process of diversification of biological populations through successive generations \cite{Hall2008}.

The availability of high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies has revolutionized biology by transforming it
into an ever more data-driven and compute-intense discipline \cite{Escobar-Zepeda2015}.
In particular, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) \cite{Logares2012} has given rise to novel methods for studying
microbial environments \cite{Morgan2010,Edwards2013,Sunagawa2013a,Matsen2015}.
NGS techniques are often used in metagenomic studies to sequence organisms
in water \cite{Karsenti2011,Giner2016,Gran-Stadniczenko2017} or soil \cite{Dupont2016,Mahe2017} samples,
in the human microbiome \cite{Huttenhower2012,Methe2012,Srinivasan2012},
and a plethora of other environments.
These studies yield a large set of short anonymous DNA sequences, so-called reads, for each sample.
Reads that are obtained from specific parts of the genome are called meta-barcoding reads;
most often, reads are amplified before sequencing and later de-replicated again, resulting in so-called amplicons.

High-throughput DNA sequencing technologies have revolutionized biology by transforming it
into a data-driven computational discipline \citep{Escobar-Zepeda2015}.
Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods now allow for studying microbial samples
directly extracted from their environment \citep{Morgan2010,Edwards2013,Sunagawa2013a,Matsen2015,Oulas2015}
For each sample, these methods yield a set of short, anonymous DNA sequences, so-called reads.

also, we can infer trees \cite{Felsenstein2004}

\cite{Yang2006}


inference can be interpreted as a search in the space of all possible trees for the tree that maximizes some optimality criterion.

for a given number of taxa $n$, the number of distinct tree topologies N is given as
$N(n) = \prod_{i=3}^{n} (2i - 5)$
grows over-exponentially fast
\cite{Felsenstein2004}

space is large, so there are different approaches and heuristics to inferring trees.

Distance based methods such as \emph{Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean} (UPGMA) \cite{Sokal1958}
and \emph{Neighbor Joining} \cite{Saitou1987}
use a pairwise distance matrix between sequences, and thus do not necessarily need an alignment.
\emph{Maximum Parsimony} \cite{Sankoff1975} uses an optimality criterion that is based on Occam's razor,
that is, it yields the tree that explains the observed tip sequences (taxa)
with the minimal number of substitutions (mutations).
Furthermore, there is \emph{Bayesian Inference},
in which Bayes' theorem is used to calculate the posterior distribution of the relevant evolutionary processes,
and which thus can incorporate prior empirical knowledge into the process.

% ======================================================================================================================
%     Motivation
% ======================================================================================================================

\subsection{Motivation}
\label{ch:Foundations:sec:PhylogeneticPlacement:sub:Motivation}


problem with ngs data:
msa is NP-hard \cite{Just2001}.
inferring tree for this many sequences is also NP-hard \cite{Chor2005} even harder (over exp.), plus
short sequences (not phylo signal), so cannot resolve relationtips between sequences


% although the methods generally are applicable to both.
A typical task in metagenomic studies is to identify and classify these sequences with respect
to known reference sequences, either in a taxonomic or phylogenetic context.
% another typical task: to discover novel diversity. not here.

Conventional methods like \toolname{Blast} \cite{Altschul1990} are based on sequence similarity.
Such methods are fast, but only attain satisfying accuracy levels
if the query sequences (e.g., the environmental reads or amplicons) are sufficiently similar to the reference sequences.
Furthermore, the best \toolname{Blast} hit does often \emph{not} represent the most closely related species \cite{Koski2001}.
% \todo{Mention further methods here, for example Vervier 2015}
This is particularly true for environments where available reference databases
do not exhibit sufficient taxon coverage \citep{Mahe2017}.
As insufficient taxon coverage cannot be detected by methods that are based on sequence similarity,
they can potentially bias downstream analyses.

Alternatively, so-called phylogenetic (or evolutionary) placement methods \cite{Matsen2010,Berger2011,Barbera2018}
identify query sequences based on a phylogenetic tree of reference sequences.
Thereby, they incorporate information about the evolutionary history of the species under study
and hence provide a more accurate means for read identification.
The result of phylogenetic placement is a mapping of the query sequences to the branches of the reference tree.
Such a mapping also elucidates the evolutionary distance between the query and the reference sequences.

This information represents useful biological knowledge \emph{per se}.
For example, the classification of query sequences can be summarized by means of sequence abundances \cite{Pace1997,Hugenholtz1998},
or to obtain taxonomic annotations \cite{Kozlov2016}.
The data can also be utilized to derive further knowledge or hypotheses.
Existing methods such as Edge PCA and Squash Clustering \cite{Matsen2011a} are, for instance, able
to visualize differences between sets of metagenomic samples,
or to cluster samples based on placement similarity.
Note that distinct samples from one study are typically mapped to the same underlying reference tree,
thus facilitating such comparisons.



phylogenetic placement \cite{Matsen2010,Berger2011,Barbera2018}, cited more than 630 times (as of 2018-07-01)
considered an established method

There also exist variants of phylogenetic placement that use maximum parsimony \cite{Berger2011}
and minimum evolution \cite{Filipski2015} instead of maximum likelihood,
variants that calculate Bayesian posterior probabilities \cite{Matsen2010},
and boosting methods to improve the accuracy of the placements \cite{Mirarab2012}.
Phylogenetic placement has been used for a variety of applications and derived pipelines, such as
species delimitation \cite{Zhang2013,Kapli2017},
genome and metagenome analysis \cite{Darling2014},
taxonomic identification and phylogenetic profiling \cite{Nguyen2014}, and
identification and correction of taxonomically mislabeled sequences \cite{Kozlov2016}.

%     Introduction
% ======================================================================================================================

\subsection{Introduction}
\label{ch:Foundations:sec:PhylogeneticPlacement:sub:Introduction}

\todo{pipeline diagram, data flow, etc, reference to chapters?!}

In brief, phylogenetic placement calculates the most probable insertion branches for each given \acf{QS} on a \acf{RT}.
The \acp{QS} are reads or amplicons from environmental samples; most often barcoding regions or marker genes are used.
The \ac{RT} and the reference sequences it represents are typically assembled by the user
so that they capture the expected species diversity in the samples.
Nonetheless, we recently presented an automated approach
for selecting and constructing appropriate reference sequences from large sequence databases \cite{Czech2018}.
As phylogenetic placement used a maximum likelihood criterion, the \ac{RT} has to be strictly bifurcating.
Prior to the placement, the \acp{QS} need to be aligned against the reference alignment of the \ac{RT} by programs such as
\toolname{PaPaRa} \cite{Berger2011a,Berger2012} or
\toolname{hmmalign}, which is part of the \toolname{HMMER} suite \cite{Eddy1998,Eddy2009}.
The placement is then conducted by initially inserting one \ac{QS} as a new tip into a branch of the tree,
then re-optimizing the branch lengths that are most affected by the insertion,
and thereafter evaluating the resulting likelihood score of the tree under a given model of nucleotide evolution,
such as the Generalized Time-Reversible (GTR) model \cite{Tavare1986}.
The \ac{QS} is then removed from the current branch and subsequently placed into all other branches of the \ac{RT}.

Thus, for each branch of the tree, the process yields a so-called \emph{placement} of the \ac{QS},
that is, an optimized position on the branch, along with a likelihood score for the whole tree.
The likelihood scores for a \ac{QS} are then transformed into probabilities,
which quantify the uncertainty of placing the sequence on the respective branch \cite{Strimmer2002,VonMering2007}.
Those probabilities are called \acp{LWR}.
The accumulated \ac{LWR} sum over all branches for a single \ac{QS} is $1.0$.
\figref{fig:tree_epa} shows an example depicting the placements of one \ac{QS}, including the respective \acp{LWR}.

\begin{figure}[hpbt]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.6\linewidth]{pppp/tree_epa.pdf}
    \caption[Phylogenetic Placement of a Query Sequence]{
        \textbf{Phylogenetic Placement of a Query Sequence.}
        Each branch of the reference tree is tested as a potential insertion position, called a ``placement'' (blue dots).
        Note that placements have a specific position on their branch, due to the branch length optimization process.
        A probability of how likely it is that the sequence belongs to a specific branch is computed
        (numbers next to dots),
        which is called the \emph{likelihood weight ratio} (LWR).
%         based on the maximum likelihood score of the whole tree. %(that is, including the query sequence)
        The bold number (0.7) denotes the most probable placement of the sequence.
    }
    \label{fig:tree_epa}
\end{figure}

This process is repeated for every \ac{QS}.
Note that the placement process is conducted {\em independently} for each \ac{QS}.
% Shorter: This placement process is conducted independently for each sequence.
That is, for each \ac{QS}, the algorithm starts calculating placements from scratch on the original \ac{RT}.
%This enables parallelization,
%and avoids unstable trees, which might result from adding too many sequences of short length to the tree.

In summary, the result of a phylogenetic placement analysis is a mapping of the \acp{QS} in a sample
to positions on the branches of the \ac{RT}.
Each such position, along with the corresponding \ac{LWR}, is called a placement of the \ac{QS}.
% The result of phylogenetic placement is a mapping of each \ac{QS} (e.g., environmental reads)
% to positions on the branches of the \ac{RT}, amended by probabilities in form of their likelihood weight ratios.
% Each \ac{QS} is thus represented by its placement positions, which are also called its placements.
% along with the respective likelihood weight ratios.f
% total: sum up. placement profile. imbalance. explain in later chapter.
% Here, we use these sample profiles to discover: clusters, correlation with meta-data.

\todo{besser unterbringen}
The data is usually stored in so-called \fileformat{jplace} files \cite{Matsen2012}.

Each such sample represents a geographical location, a body site, a point in time, etc.
In the following, we represent a sample by the placement locations of its metagenomic \acp{QS},
including the respective per-branch \acp{LWR}.
Furthermore, for a specific analysis, we assume the standard use case,
that is, all placements were computed on the same fixed \acf{RT} and \acl{RA}.


This mapping can be seen as an identification and classification of the \acp{QS} in terms of the \ac{RT},
similar to a taxonomic assignment.
However, phylogenetic placement also allows for more elaborate downstream analyses.
Firstly, the reference tree usually offers a higher resolution than simple per-taxon abundance counts,
and the amount of mapped \acp{QS} per branch can be directly visualized on the \ac{RT} \citep{Mahe2017}.
Secondly, established methods such as Edge PCA and Squash Clustering \citep{Matsen2011a}
allow for identifying subtle differences between distinct samples,
thus enabling comparative studies directly based on phylogenetic placement.
Lastly, we recently proposed novel methods for visualizing and clustering phylogenetic placement data \citep{Czech2018a},
which, for example, can reveal correlations of per-sample meta-data features with sequence abundances.


Furthermore, phylogenetic placement is used in a variety of derived tools,
such as \toolname{(m)PTP} (species delimitation; \cite{Zhang2013,Kapli2017}),
\toolname{SEPP} (boosting; \cite{Mirarab2012}),
\toolname{PhyloSift} (metagenome analysis; \cite{Darling2014}),
\toolname{Sativa} (identification and correction of taxonomically mislabeled sequences; \cite{Kozlov2016})
and \toolname{TIPP} (taxonomic identification and phylogenetic profiling; \cite{Nguyen2014}).

A phylogenetic placement can be carried out {\em if} the \acp{QS} can be aligned to the reference alignment.
Often, barcoding regions such as 16S or 18S are used,
but there also exist studies that use different, or even a set of, maker genes \citep{Sunagawa2013a}.
Furthermore, other types of sequences such as $_{\text{mi}}$tags %\textsubscript{mi}tags
\citep{Logares2014} can be used.

\section{Phylogenetic Placement Processing}
\label{ch:Foundations:sec:PhylogeneticPlacementProcessing}

% thus, wehn dealing with many samples, an imporatn question is how to make them comparable when differing numbres o sequences
% the problem arises because different samples zies. can span many order sof magnitude.
When placing multiple samples, for instance, from different locations,
typically, the same \ac{RT} is used, in order to allow for comparisons of the phylogenetic composition of these samples.
In this context, it is important to consider how to properly normalize the samples.
Normalization is required as the sample size (often also called library size),
that is, the number of sequences per sample, can vary by several orders of magnitude,
due to efficiency variations in the sequencing process or biases introduced by the amplification process.
Selecting an appropriate normalization strategy constitutes a common problem in many metagenomic studies.
The appropriateness depends on data characteristics \cite{Weiss2017}, but also on the biological question asked.
For example, estimating indices such as the species richness are often implemented
via rarefaction and rarefaction curves \cite{Gotelli2001},
which however ignores a potentially large amount of the available valid data \cite{McMurdie2014}.
Furthermore, the specific type of input sequence data has to be taken into account for normalization:
Biases induced by the amplification process can potentially be avoided if, instead of amplicons,
data based on shotgun sequencing are used, such as \textsubscript{mi}tags \cite{Logares2014}.
Moreover, the sequences can be clustered prior to phylogenetic placement analysis,
for instance, by constructing operational taxonomic units (OTUs) \cite{Edgar2010,Mahe2014,Mahe2015,Rognes2016}.
Analyses using OTUs focus on species diversity instead of simple abundances.
OTU clustering substantially reduces the number of sequences,
and hence greatly decreases the computational cost for placement analyses.
Lastly, one may completely ignore the abundances (which are called ``multiplicities'' of placements) of the placed
sequences, reads, or OTUs, and only be interested in their presence/absence when comparing samples.

Which of the above analysis strategies is deployed,
depends on the specific design of the study and the research question at hand.
The common challenge is that the number of sequences per sample differs, which affects most post-analysis methods.
Before introducing our methods,
we therefore explain how the necessary normalizations of sample sizes can be performed in the following.
We also describe general techniques for interpreting and working with phylogenetic placement data.
%These are not methods of their own, but tools necessary for later.
Some of these techniques have been used before as building blocks
for methods like Edge PCA and Squash Clustering \cite{Matsen2011a,Evans2012}. \todo{see below}
%and we mostly stick to established terminology.

% ======================================================================================================================
%     Edge Masses
% ======================================================================================================================

\subsection{Edge Masses}
\label{ch:Foundations:sec:PhylogeneticPlacementProcessing:sub:EdgeMasses}

Methods that compare samples directly based on their sequences,
such as the UniFrac distance \cite{Lozupone2005,Lozupone2007a},
can benefit from rarefaction \cite{Weiss2017}.
However, in the context of phylogenetic placement, rarefaction is not necessary.
Thus, more valid data can be kept.
% Directly comparing individual anonymous sequences can be too computationally demanding for large contemporary metagenomic datasets.
% hence, the quantitative methods we present here do not consider the \acp{QS} individually.
% as contemporary metagenomic datasets are often too large to allow for this level of granularity,
To this end, it is convenient to think of the reference tree as a graph
(when exploiting graph properties of the tree, we refer to the branches of the tree as edges).
Then, the per-branch \acp{LWR} for a single \ac{QS}
can be interpreted as mass points distributed over the edges of the \ac{RT},
including their respective placement positions on the branches,
cf.~\figref{fig:tree_epa}.
This implies that each \ac{QS} has a total accumulated mass of $1.0$ on the \ac{RT}.
We call this the \emph{mass interpretation} of the placed \acp{QS}, and henceforth use mass and \ac{LWR} interchangeably.
The \emph{mass of an edge} refers to the sum of the \acp{LWR} on that edge for all \acp{QS} of a sample,
as shown in \figref{fig:imbalance:sub:ReferenceTree}.
The total mass of a sample is then the sum over all edge masses,
which is identical to the number of \acp{QS} in the sample.
% \todo{This neglects that not all placements are stored in jplace, so that the mass per QS can be $<1$.
% This fact is not necessary for explaining any of the methods (although it is accounted for in my implementation).
% I think we can thus omit it for simplicity.}

        Reference tree where each edge is annotated with the normalized mass (first value, blue) and
        imbalance (second value, red) of the placements in a sample.
        The imbalance is the sum of masses on the root side of the edge minus the sum of the masses on the non-root side.
        The depicted tree is unrooted, hence, its top-level trifurcation (gray dot) is used as ``root'' node.
        An exemplary calculation of the imbalance is given at the top.
        Because terminal edges only have a root side, their imbalance is not informative.
        \subref{fig:imbalance:sub:Matrices}
        The masses and imbalances for the edges of a sample constitute the rows of the first two matrices.
        The third matrix contains the available meta-data features for each sample.
        These matrices are used to calculate, for instance, the edge principal components or correlation coefficients.
    }
    \label{fig:imbalance}
\end{figure}

The key idea is to use the distribution of placement mass points over the edges of the \ac{RT} to characterize a sample.
This allows for normalizing samples of different size
by scaling the total sample mass to unit mass $1.0$.
In other words, absolute abundances are converted into relative abundances.
This way, rare species, which might have been removed by rarefaction, can be kept,
as they only contribute a negligible mass to the branches into which they have been placed.
This approach is analogous to using proportional values for methods based on OTU count tables,
that is, scaling each sample/column of the table by its sum of OTU counts \cite{Weiss2017}.
% In the following, we will mostly work with normalized samples.
Most of the methods presented here use normalized samples, that is, they use relative abundances.
As relative abundances are compositional data, certain caveats occur \cite{Aitchison1986,Lovell2015},
which we discuss where appropriate.

When working with large numbers of \acp{QS},
the mass interpretation allows to further simplify and reduce the data:
The masses on each edge of the tree can be quantized into $b$ discrete bins,
that is, each edge is divided into $b$ intervals (or bins) of the corresponding branch length.
All mass points on that edge are then accumulated into their respective nearest bin.
% , for example, at their nearest interval midpoint.
% Using midpoints means that masses are only minimally moved.
The parameter $b$ controls the resolution and accuracy of this approximation.
In the extreme case $b:=1$, all masses on an edge are grouped into one single bin.
This \emph{branch binning} process drastically reduces the number of mass points
that need to be stored and analyzed in several methods we present,
while only inducing a negligible decrease in accuracy.
As shown in \tabref{tab:hmp_binning_error}.
branch binning can yield a speedup of up to 75\% for post-analysis run-times.

Furthermore, using masses allows to summarize a set of samples
by annotating the \ac{RT} with their average per-edge mass distribution.
This procedure, also called \emph{squashing} \cite{Matsen2011a}, sums over all sample masses per edge
and then normalizes them once more to obtain unit mass for this resulting average tree.
This normalized tree thereby summarizes the (sub-)set of samples it represents.

\subsection{Edge Imbalances}
\label{ch:Foundations:sec:PhylogeneticPlacementProcessing:sub:EdgeImbalances}

So far, we have only considered the per-edge masses.
Often, however, it is also of interest to ``summarize'' the mass of an entire clade. %, that is, to consider per-clade masses.
For example, sequences of the \ac{RT} that represent species or strains might not provide sufficient phylogenetic signal
for properly resolving the phylogenetic placement of short sequences \cite{Dunthorn2014}.
In these cases, the placement mass of a sequence can be spread across different edges representing the same genus or species,
thus blurring analyses based on per-edge masses.
% e.g., when using regions of the genome that lack the necessary phylogenetic signal for species delimitation.
% In that case, the distinction between masses on two related species branches ...
% it might be more useful to ``summarize'' the mass for the whole genus, that is, to consider per-clade masses.
% These masses then can be interpreted relative to the masses in the rest of the tree.
% The above visualizations show each edge individually, that is, they do not reveal information about whole clades.
Instead, a clade-based summary can yield clearer analysis results.
It can be computed by using the tree structure to appropriately transform the edge masses.
% The \acp{RT} used for phylogenetic placement are generally unrooted.
% They contain however a special node, the top-level trifurcation,
% which serves as a ``hook'' when drawing and storing the tree, and which we can consider as a root for simplicity.
Each edge splits the tree into two parts, of which only one contains the root (or top-level trifurcation) of the tree.
For a given edge, its mass difference is then calculated by summing all masses in the root part of the tree
and subtracting all masses in the other part,
while ignoring the mass of the edge itself \cite{Matsen2011a}.
% For a given edge, the edge mass difference is calculated as the difference between
% the sum of masses on the root side of the edge and all masses on the other side \cite{Matsen2011a}.
This difference is called the \emph{imbalance} of the edge.
It is usually normalized to represent unit total mass,
as the absolute (not normalized) imbalance otherwise propagates the effects of differing sample sizes all across the tree.
% doesn't matter where the root is, entries will change relative to each other accordingly when re-rooting
An example of the imbalance calculation is shown in \figref{fig:imbalance:sub:ReferenceTree}.
The edge imbalance relates the masses on the two sides of an edge to each other.
This implicitly captures the \ac{RT} topology and reveals information about its clades.
Furthermore, this transformation can also reveal differences in the placement mass distribution
of nearby branches of the tree.
This is in contrast to the KR distance, which yields low values for masses that are close to each other on the tree.
% This is for example useful when the tree contains taxa representing species or even strain level,
% which can often not be resolved using phylogenetic placement,
% e.g., when using regions of the genome that lack the necessary phylogenetic signal for species delimitation.
%Note that, %for normalized samples with unit total mass,
%the imbalance of a leaf edge is simply the total mass of the tree minus the mass of the edge.
% It thus contains mostly irrelevant information and can often be left out.
Examples that illustrate the different use cases for edge mass and edge imbalance metrics are shown in the Results section.

The edge masses and edge imbalances per sample can be summarized by two matrices,
which we use for all further downstream edge- and clade-related analyses, respectively.
In these matrices, each row corresponds to a sample, and each column to an edge of the \ac{RT}.
Note that these matrices can either store absolute or relative abundances,
depending on whether the placement mass was normalized.

Furthermore, many studies provide meta-data for their samples,
for instance, the pH value or temperature of the samples' environment.
Such meta-data features can also be summarized in a per-sample matrix, where each column corresponds to one feature.
The three matrices are shown in \figref{fig:imbalance:sub:Matrices}.
Quantitative meta-data features are the most suitable for our purposes,
as they can be used to detect correlations with the placement mass distributions of samples.
For example, Edge principal components analysis (Edge PCA) \cite{Matsen2011a}
is a method that utilizes the imbalance matrix to detect and visualize edges
with a high heterogeneity of mass difference between samples.
Edge PCA further allows to annotate its plots with meta-data variables, for instance, by coloring,
thus establishing a connection between differences in samples and differences in their meta-data \cite{Srinivasan2012}.
In the following, we propose several new techniques to analyze placement data and their associated meta-data.
