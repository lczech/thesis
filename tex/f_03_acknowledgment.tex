% Andre:
%
% First and foremost, I would like to thank Prof. Alexandros Stamatakis for several years
% of excellent scientific supervision, for sharing his expertise and for providing me with
% guidance and freedom in equal parts for accomplishing this thesis.
% I am grateful to Prof. Bernhard Misof for his interest in my research and for agreeing
% to review this thesis. Furthermore, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to
% Prof. Fredrik Ronquist for hosting my research stay at the Naturhistoriska riksmuseet in
% Stockholm, many discussions on Bayesian matters and the intensive research experience
%  ̈
% on Oland.
% On a personal note, I am thankful for the consistent support of my parents Jakob and
% Anita and my brother Dominik. In particular, my deepest gratitude goes to Sabrina
% with whom I could share the ups and downs of my scientific development like with no
% other person.
% As a research venue, the Exelixis lab excels by bringing together a talented group
% of people with diverse backgrounds. Thus, a thanks for many hours of interesting dis-
% cussions and collaboration goes to Fernando Izquierdo-Carrasco, Simon Berger, Nikos
% Alachiotis, Pavlos Pavlidis, Kassian Kobert, Jiajie Zhang, Solon Pissis, Tom ́aˇs Flouri,
% Diego Darriba, Paschalia Kapli, Alexey Kozlov and Lucas Czech. Moreover, I am happy
% that my paths crossed with Mark Holder, Emily McTavish, Will Pearse and Christian
% Goll.
% Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to Klaus Tschira, founder of the Heidelberg
% Institute for Theoretical Studies which provided the funding for my position.

% Alexey:
%
% Above all, I want to thank my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Alexandros Stamatakis for his
% invaluable assistance. He was always extremely supportive in both scientific and
% non-scientific matters, and I felt lucky to work under his guidance.
% I am furthermore grateful to my co-advisor Prof. Dr. David Posada, who kindly
% agreed to review this thesis. I also appreciate our ongoing collaboration on cancer
% cell phylogeny inference, and I would like to thank Prof. Posada for hosting me
% during my research visit to Vigo.
% My former and current colleagues Fernando Izquierdo-Carrasco, Jiajie Zhang,
% Tomas Flouri, Paschalia Kapli, Andre Aberer, Kassian Kobert, Diego Darriba, Lu-
% cas Czech, Pierre Barbera, Sarah Lutteropp, Benoit Morel, Rudolf Biczok and Dora
% Serdari were always friendly, collaborative and willing to share their knowledge. I
% always enjoyed spending my time with them, be it in the lab, on the Neckarwiese, or
% at one of the inventive cocktail parties organized by Lucas. I was also happy to share
% my workplace and to exchange ideas with our short- and long-term visitors Mark
% Holder, Emily Jane McTavish, Rebecca Harris, Nikos Psonis, Khouloud Madhbouh,
% and Laura Rubinat. I am grateful to my collaborators Pelin Yilmaz, Karen Meuse-
% mann, Ralph Peters, Oliver Niehuis, Manuela Sann, Sara Bank, Oliver Ratmann,
% and Micah Dunthorn for productive teamwork and interesting discussions. Further-
% more, I would like to express my gratitude to Nick Goldman, Adam Leache and
% Deren Eaton for their helpful hints with respect to sequence uncertainty modeling.
% Beyond work, I am sincerely thankful to all my friends from Karlsruhe, Hei-
% delberg and Ladenburg, who accompanied me in countless leisure activities during
% these four years. In particular, I would like to acknowledge Felix and Dasha for be-
% ing my faithful team fellows in the ’What?Where?When?’ quiz game, and also for
% giving me (maybe a bit too) ample diversion opportunities during the final writing
% phase. Speaking of which, nothing helped me to concentrate on the writing like the
% music of God is an Astronaut. And Scar Symmetry (among many other great metal
% bands) yielded a speedup of at least 2× for coding and cluster job submission tasks.
% Finally and importantly, I am grateful to the Klaus Tschira Foundation for
% funding my position, and to the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies for
% providing an excellent work environment.

% Thanks to all of you!
