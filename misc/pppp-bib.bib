    abstract = {The problem of identifying subtle time-space clustering of disease, as may be occurring in leukemia, is described and reviewed. Published approaches, generally associated with studies of leukemia, not dependent on knowledge of the underlying population for their validity, are directed towards identifying clustering by establishing a relationship between the temporal and the spatial separations for the n(n - 1)/2 possible pairs which can be formed from the n observed cases of disease. Here it is proposed that statistical power can be improved by applying a reciprocal transform to these separations. While a permutational approach can give valid probability levels for any observed association, for reasons of practicability, it is suggested that the observed association be tested relative to its permutational variance. Formulas and computational procedures for doing so are given. While the distance measures between points represent symmetric relationships subject to mathematical and geometric regularities, the variance formula developed is appropriate for arbitrary relationships. Simplified procedures are given for the case of symmetric and skew-symmetric relationships. The general procedure is indicated as being potentially useful in other situations as, for example, the study of interpersonal relationships. Viewing the procedure as a regression approach, the possibility for extending it to nonlinear and multivariate situations is suggested. Other aspects of the problem and of the procedure developed are discussed. Similarly, pure temporal clustering can be identified by a study of incidence rates in periods of widespread epidemics. In point of fact, many epidemics of communicable diseases are somewhat local in nature and so these do actually constitute temporal-spatial clusters. For leukemia and similar diseases in which cases seem to arise substantially at random rather than as clear-cut epidemics, it is necessary to devise sensitive and efficient procedures for detecting any nonrandom component of disease occurrence. Various ingenious procedures which statisticians have developed for the detection of disease clustering are reviewed here. These procedures can be generalized so as to increase their statistical validity and efficiency. The technic to be given below for imparting statistical validity to the procedures already in vogue can be viewed as a generalized form of regression with possible useful application to problems arising in quite different contexts. {\textcopyright}1967 American Association for Cancer Research.},

@article{Lomas2000,
    abstract = {Diatoms, but not flagellates, have been shown to increase rates of nitrogen release after a shift from a low growth irradiance to a much higher experimental irradiance. We compared NO3− uptake kinetics, internal inorganic nitrogen storage, and the temperature dependence of the NO3− reduction enzymes, nitrate (NR) and nitrite reductase (NiR), in nitrogen‐replete cultures of 3 diatoms (Chaetoceros sp., Skeletonema costatum, Thalassiosira weissflogii) and 3 flagellates (Dunaliella tertiolecta, Pavlova lutheri, Prorocentrum minimum) to provide insight into the differences in nitrogen release patterns observed between these species. At NO3− concentrations {\textless}40 $\mu$mol‐N{\textperiodcentered}L−1, all the diatom species and the dinoflagellate P. minimum exhibited saturating kinetics, whereas the other flagellates, D. tertiolecta and P. lutheri, did not saturate, leading to very high estimated K s values. Above ∼60 $\mu$mol‐N{\textperiodcentered}L−1, NO3− uptake rates of all species tested continued to increase in a linear fashion. Rates of NO3− uptake at 40 $\mu$mol‐N{\textperiodcentered}L−1, normalized to cellular nitrogen, carbon, cell number, and surface area, were generally greater for diatoms than flagellates. Diatoms stored significant amounts of NO3− internally, whereas the flagellate species stored significant amounts of NH4+. Half‐saturation concentrations for NR and NiR were similar between all species, but diatoms had significantly lower temperature optima for NR and NiR than did the flagellates tested in most cases. Relative to calculated biosynthetic demands, diatoms were found to have greater NO3− uptake and NO3− reduction rates than flagellates. This enhanced capacity for NO3− uptake and reduction along with the lower optimum temperature for enzyme activity could explain differences in nitrogen release patterns between diatoms and flagellates after an increase in irradiance.},

@article{Filker2017,
    abstract = {The RNA-guided nuclease CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated nuclease 9) and its variants such as nickase Cas9, dead Cas9, guide RNA scaffolds and RNA-targeting Cas9 are convenient and versatile platforms for site-specific genome editing and epigenome modulation. They are easy-to-use, simple-to-design, and capable of targeting multiple loci simultaneously. Given that cancer develops from cumulative genetic and epigenetic alterations, CRISPR-Cas9 and its variants (hereafter referred to as CRISPR-Cas9 systems) hold extensive application potentials in cancer modeling and therapy. To date, they have already been applied to model oncogenic mutations in cell lines1 and in adult animals2 , as well as to combat cancer by disabling oncogenic viruses3 or by manipulating cancer genome4 . Given the importance of epigenome and transcriptome in tumorigenesis, manipulation of cancer epigenome and transcriptome for cancer modeling and therapy is a promising area in the future. Whereas (epi)genetic modifications of cancer microenvironment with CRISPR-Cas9 systems for therapeutic purposes represent another promising area in cancer research. Herein, we introduce the functions and mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas9 systems in genome editing and epigenome modulation, retrospect their applications in cancer modelling and therapy, discuss limitations and possible solutions, and propose future directions, in hope of providing concise and enlightening information for readers interested in this area.

The model fits metabolic rates of microbes, ectotherms, endotherms (including those in hibernation), and plants in temperatures ranging from 0{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}} to 40{\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C. Mass- and temperature-compensated resting metabolic rates of all organisms are similar: The lowest (for unicellular organisms and plants) is separated from the highest (for endothermic vertebrates) by a factor of about 20.
